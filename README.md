# competingconsumers
Competing consumers demo with mass transit and rabbitmq


Requires:  
a machine running RabbitMQ (currently set to localhost)


Please Note:  
  
the web.config and app.config files are mostly ignored by the code. This is because the values have been hard coded to make it more obvious in technical demonstrations.
